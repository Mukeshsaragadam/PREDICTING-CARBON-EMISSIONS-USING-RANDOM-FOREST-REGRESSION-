# PREDICTING-CARBON-EMISSIONS-USING-RANDOM-FOREST-REGRESSION-

Predicting Carbon Emissions

Overview

This project focuses on predicting carbon emissions using machine learning techniques. The notebook contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to estimate carbon emissions based on various features.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and relationships.

Model Training: Implementing regression models to predict emissions.

Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy and performance.


Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially:

jupyter notebook "PREDICTING CARBON EMISSIONS.ipynb"

Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, train models, and interpret results.

Dataset

The dataset includes relevant features influencing carbon emissions, such as:

Vehicle specifications

Fuel consumption

Engine characteristics

Model Performance

Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to determine the best predictive approach. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are used for evaluation.
